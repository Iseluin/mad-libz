Be that word our sign of parting[v], bird[n] or fiend[n]! I shrieked[v], upstarting[a] -- <br><br>
"Get thee back into the tempest and the Nights Plutonian[a] shore! -
Leave[v] no black[a] plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken[v]! <br><br>
Leave[v] my loneliness[a] unbroken! quit[v] the bust[n] above my door! <br><br>
Take[v] thy beak from out my heart[n], and take[v] thy form from off my door!” <br><br>
Quoth the Raven[n] “Nevermore.”
